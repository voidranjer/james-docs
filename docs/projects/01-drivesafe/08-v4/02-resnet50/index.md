sidebar_label: v4 – Why ResNet50 is important
--- 

This page is meant to explain our findings from making the jump from **v3 to v4** and why using just the LSTM layer was not enough to capture the features in the data.

## Why ResNet50?

The **ResNet50** model is a **pre-trained** model that has been trained on the **ImageNet** dataset. It is a **deep convolutional neural network** that has been trained to recognize objects and features in images.

## Image Features

- Edges and Lines
- Corners and Key Points
- Texture Patterns
- Color Historgrams
- Gradent Orientation
- Scale-Invariant Features
- Deep Learning Features
