Some indespensible resources that I used to learn and configure my Doom Emacs instance.

<!--truncate-->

---

## Misc

- Restarting the Emacs server: `emacsclient -e '(save-buffers-kill-emacs)'`
- `SPC p k`: Kill all project buffers
- `SPC p p`, `SPC p a`, `SPC p b`, `SPC p f`
- `SPC /`: Search within project
- `SPC TAB k`, `M-[123]`: Workspace

## [Doom Emacs Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/niyumard/Doom-Emacs-Cheat-Sheet?tab=readme-ov-file)

This cheat sheet is especially useful for learning Doom Emacs. Lot's of cool tips and tricks!

## [Treemacs](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs)

### Minor modes

- Indent-guide mode
- Git mode (Extended)
- Follow mode

## Dired mode

- https://ashok-khanna.medium.com/introduction-to-dired-mode-91cecd3a06ff
- WDired mode

## Vim

I won't go in-detail, but here are some really useful mechanisms to look up in Vim *(assuming familiarity with basic Vim fundementals)*:

- Markers
- Registers, specifically `C-r, "`
- [Multi-cursor replacement](https://medium.com/@schtoeffel/you-don-t-need-more-than-one-cursor-in-vim-2c44117d51db)
- `:e!`: Reset all unsaved changes
- Using `C-r, "` to paste from clipboard when in command mode, especially useful for using `/` search
- `gd`: Go to Definition (requires LSP)
- `za`: Toggle folding

## Complimentary Software

### [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)

This is a browser extension that will allow you to use Vim hotkeys to navigate the browser, e.g.: `(/, h, j, k, l, o, d, u)`
Pro-tip: In the `o` search menu, use `C-j` or `C-k` to navigate without using the arrow keys.

### [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-in-the-command-line)

```fish
alias ghask='gh copilot explain'
alias ghcmd='gh copilot suggest'
alias lg='lazygit'
```

### i3wm

## Roadmap

### Nix

Emacs and Doom Emacs depend on a number of external packages. As well, if you plan on adding your own configurations that make use of external libraries, Nix helps with this.

Nix is a package manager with a completely different approach to package management (compared with the standards, like dpkg, dnf, the AUR, etc). I will not provide a whole argument for Nix here, but the tldr is: by packaging your Emacs config into a Nix package, it will work on virtually any Linux distro.
